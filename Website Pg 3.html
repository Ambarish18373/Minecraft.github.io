<u>Ways of playing the Game</u> <br> <br>
First way:<br>

The First Way is also called  Speed run.
When you first spawn in the world your first aim will be to get wood. Wood is the most essential item in the game. After that craft wooden 
tools like a Pickaxe and an Axe. Dig 4-5 blocks down and mine stone. With that being done get your crafting table and craft stone tools.
Next fetch for Animals as your saturation bar might be low. You can cook the food in the furnace using Coal or Wood. I would prefer you to cook
the food than eating it raw because cooked food fills more saturation points. If you are speedrunning for a record then you will need atleast 3 
iron ingots to craft a bucket and then you can fill water in it. This is needed to build the nether portal: The gateway to the Nether world. You will
also need 10 sources of lava. The tutorial to build it will be available on Youtube. Light up the portal with a  'Flint and Steel' and enter the portal.
After entering the Nether you should look for a Nether fortress. After finding the fortress find a blaze spawner and kill blazes untill you get 7-8
blaze rods. Then go and mine gold to trade with piglins. Piglins are hostile mobs which trade ender pearls for gold ingots. After that craft your
blaze rods into blaze powder and combine it with the pearls to craft eye of ender. Exit the nether  and proceed towards the stronghold.
 You can do this by throwing your ender eyes. After finding the stronghold find the portal room and fill the eyes in the portal frames.
Then enter the End Dimension and kill the dragon Using the Bed method or your Sword/Axe. Then you have finally beaten the game.<br>

<br>

Second Way: <br>
The first way is to start collecting materials for a base. You can build a base, gather resources useful for the dragon fight like:<br>
1) Get netherite armor(the best armor in the game). <br>
2) Enchant all weaponry and armor. <br>
3) Collect 12 ender pearls (minimum needed to fill the end portal).  <br>
4) Get 6 blaze rods (minimum needed to craft the ender eyes). <br>
5) Locate the End portal. <br>
6) Kill the ender dragon. <br> <br>
You can also build a lot of automatic farms, villager trading halls etc. You can also build map arts.
