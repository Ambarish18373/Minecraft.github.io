Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<br>
 However, there is an achievement system, known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay<br>
 is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects<br>
—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core <br>
gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world.<br>
 Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as<br>
 unrealistic. The game also contains a material known as redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic<br>
 gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.

When starting a new world, players must choose one of five game modes, as well as one of four difficulties, ranging from peaceful to hard. Increasing
 the difficulty of the game causes the player to take more damage from mobs, as well as having other difficulty-specific effects.
 For example, the peaceful difficulty prevents hostile mobs from spawning, and the hard difficulty allows players to starve to death if their hunger
 bar is depleted. Once selected, the difficulty can be changed, but the game mode is locked and can only be changed with cheats.
<br>
<br>

New players have a randomly selected default character skin of either Steve or Alex, but the option to create custom skins was made available
 in 2010. Players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures. Passive mobs, such as
 cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders,
 skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves. Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned
 (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear. Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper 
(an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks).
 There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk variants that spawn in deserts.
<br>
<br>

Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End. The Nether is a hell-like dimension accessed
 via player-built portals; it contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the overworld, due to every block traveled
 in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the overworld. The player can build an optional boss mob called the Wither out of materials
 found in the Nether. The End is a barren land consisting of many islands. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon dwells on the main island.
 Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which upon entering cues the game's ending credits and a poem written by Irish novelist Julian Gough.
 Players are then teleported back to their spawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.
